# Bsides-Tampa-2024_Badge-CTF

Bsides 2024 had a really fun CTF badge challenge created by c0ldbru. I rooted his box and made a copy of everything out of curiosity. Some people were interested, so I've uploaded the challenge's starting point here. I will not be mirroring the rest of the challenge, but feel free to fork and do so.

Before you get started, you need to flash the disk image [Disk image of recreated CTF challenge](https://nextcloud.l3pr.org/s/aPssoP4f9ZDZKSY) to a >16gb microsd card and plug it into a raspberry pi.

For this CTF challenge, you just checked in to Bsides Tampa 2024, and noticed some strange coded messages on your badge. Check out the pictures here:

I've replaced the bash history and most other configs with the originals, so that you can see how c0ldbru set the challenge up. Feel free to use this as a guide to build your first CTF, or just play it. Have fun y'all.
